About reCAPTCHA
---------------
Over 60 million CAPTCHAs are solved every day by people around the world.
reCAPTCHA channels this human effort into helping to digitize books from the
Internet Archive. When you solve a reCAPTCHA, you help preserve literature by
deciphering a word that was not readable by computers. 

reCAPTCHA is a project of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
University.
